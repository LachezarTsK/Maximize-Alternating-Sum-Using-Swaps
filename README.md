# Maximize-Alternating-Sum-Using-Swaps
Challenge at LeetCode.com. Tags: Union Find, Sorting, Greedy, Graph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solutions are in two variants, depending on the data structure that is applied to map the parent component to class, respectively to struct, ConnectedComponents, which contains the input values and the number of even input indexes for a group of connected components. This information is needed to calculate the maximum alternating sum using swaps for a group of connected components.

As the file names suggest, Solutions with Array applies an array for this mapping and Solutions with Hash Map applies a Hash Map for this purpose.

Depending on the programming language, some solutions run faster with the array variant than with the map variant, or vice versa, as measured by the runtime on Leetcode.
